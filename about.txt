Hello!

I can show the status of the node, the current load on the server, the parameters of the blockchain and a simple network explorer.

This is an alpha version of the bot, so there may be errors in the process.
Please, if you encounter errors, write to the telegram chats https://t.me/AkashNW (for English-speaking users) or https://t.me/akash_ru (for Russian-speaking users).
